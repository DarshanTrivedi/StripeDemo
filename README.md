# StripeDemo
Want to create commission based transaction to increase conversion rate of your website?

Stripe is one of the payment gateways, allowing individuals and businesses to accept payments over the Internet. However, getting commission based transaction with stripe is bit difficult. So, I have created a tutorial that guides developers to [integrate Stripe Payment Gateway](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-stripe-payment-gateway-android-app-create-commission-based-transaction/) and create commission based transaction to increase conversion rate of the website.

I, Darshan Trivedi, has developed this tutorial for android app developers. I am working as a Sr. [Android developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) at Space-O Technologies.
